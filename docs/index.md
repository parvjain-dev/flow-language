# Getting Started with Flow
Welcome to the official documentation for the Flow language! Flow is a declarative, type-safe language for building robust and readable data pipelines.

This guide will walk you through installing the Flow CLI and running your first script.

## Installation

Flow is distributed as a Python package. To install the command-line tool, you'll first need to clone the repository.

```sh
# Clone the project from GitHub
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)parvjain-dev/flow-language.git
cd flow-language

# Install the 'flow' command using pip
pip install -e .
