### Flow Language Rules (v1.0)

This document explains the syntax and structure of the Flow programming language.

-----

### High-Level Structure

A Flow script is composed of one or more **statements**. Each statement is a single instruction that ends with a semicolon (**`;`**).

There are four main types of statements:

1.  **Declarations** (`schema`, `source`, `sink`)
2.  **Assignments** (`variable = ...`)
3.  **Executions** (`variable -> ...`)

-----

### Data & Schema Definitions

These rules let you describe your data's structure and where it comes from and goes.

  * #### `schema`

    A **`schema`** block is a blueprint for your data. You give it a name and define all the expected column names and their types.

    ```flow
    schema User {
      id: int;
      name: string;
      status: string;
    }
    ```

  * #### `source`

    A **`source`** defines a data source. You give it a name and specify where to get the data from, such as a file. You can attach a schema to it using the **`using`** keyword to enable error checking.

    ```flow
    source users_file <- File(path: "examples/users.csv") using User;
    ```

    It can also connect to databases like PostgreSQL, securely reading credentials using the **`env()`** function.

    ```flow
    source users_db <- Postgres(
      host: "localhost",
      password: env("DB_PASSWORD"),
      table: "users"
    ) using User;
    ```

  * #### `sink`

    A **`sink`** defines a data destination. You give it a name and specify where the data should be saved.

    ```flow
    sink user_report -> File(path: "report.csv");
    ```

-----

### Pipelines & Variables

These rules are for processing your data.

  * #### `assignment`

    This lets you run a pipeline and save its result into a **variable** using the **`=`** sign. This variable can then be used as the starting point for other pipelines.

    ```flow
    active_users = users -> filter(user.status == 'active');
    ```

  * #### `execution`

    This runs a pipeline directly without saving its result to a new variable. It's used for pipelines that end in a sink.

    ```flow
    active_users -> select(id, name) -> user_report;
    ```

  * #### `pipeline`

    This is the core concept of Flow. It's a chain of operations starting with a data source (or a variable) and connected by arrows (**`->`**).

    ```flow
    // This is the pipeline part
    users -> filter(user.age > 30) -> select(name)
    ```

-----

### Transformations

Transformations are steps in a pipeline that change your data.

  * #### `filter()`

    Selects **rows** from your data that match one or more logical conditions using `and` or `or`.

    ```flow
    ... -> filter(user.age > 40 and user.status == 'active') -> ...
    ```

  * #### `select()`

    Selects **columns** from your data. You provide a comma-separated list of the columns you want to keep.

    ```flow
    ... -> select(id, name, age) -> ...
    ```

  * #### `sort()`

    Changes the **order of rows** based on one or more columns. You can specify the order as `'asc'` (ascending) or `'desc'` (descending).

    ```flow
    ... -> sort(age, order: 'desc') -> ...
    ```

  * #### `mutate()`

    Creates **new columns** based on expressions. It supports arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and string concatenation.

    ```flow
    ... -> mutate(
      full_name = user.first_name + " " + user.last_name,
      age_in_10_years = user.age + 10
    ) -> ...
    ```
